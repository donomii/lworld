# Lworld

An experiment in procedural generation using WebGL and L-systems.

## Install

	git clone https://github.com/donomii/lworld

Copy all the files to your webserver directory, or run a [micro webserver](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255).  All files are static, and the whole program is a webapp that runs in your browser.  It does require you to be online to load its supporting libraries like bootstrap and jQuery.

## Instructions

Click and drag the mouse to look around the world.  Type commands from the list to create 3D shapes.
